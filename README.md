# perltask


### i have two very sensitive files in my custom linux from scratch project, that need to be edited, considering the linux package gcc to be the foundation of a LFS project, the two files need to be changed with a program like sed or perl vey carefully i have a challenge for my perl friends to use perl to edit these files instead of sed...


## you will find copies of the files neded to be edited and a shell script called perlpeople.sh the task is to convert perlpeople.sh to perlpeople.pl
